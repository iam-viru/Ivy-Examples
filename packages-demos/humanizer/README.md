## Created Using Ivy

Web application created using [Ivy-Framework](https://github.com/Ivy-Interactive/Ivy-Framework).

**Ivy** - The ultimate framework for building internal tools with LLM code generation by unifying front-end and back-end into a single C# codebase. With Ivy, you can build robust internal tools and dashboards using C# and AI assistance based on your existing database.

Ivy is a web framework for building interactive web applications using C# and .NET.

## Interactive Example For Text Transformation

This example demonstrates text transformation using the [Humanizer library](https://github.com/Humanizr/Humanizer) integrated with Ivy. Humanizer is a powerful .NET library that provides a set of extension methods to transform strings, enums, dates, and times into a more human-readable format.

**What This Application Does:**

This specific implementation creates a **Text Humanizer** application that allows users to:

- **Transform Text**: Convert text using various humanization techniques
- **Multiple Formats**: Support for PascalCase, camelCase, kebab-case, underscore_case, and more
- **Smart Truncation**: Intelligent text truncation with customizable length
- **Real-time Results**: Instant transformation with history tracking
- **Interactive UI**: Split-panel layout with input controls on the left and results on the right
- **Code Formatting**: Results displayed in code blocks for easy copying

**Available Transformations:**

- **Humanize**: Convert to sentence case, title case, all caps, or lowercase
- **Truncate**: Smart text truncation with length control
- **Pascalize**: Convert to PascalCase (e.g., "hello world" → "HelloWorld")
- **Camelize**: Convert to camelCase (e.g., "hello world" → "helloWorld")
- **Underscore**: Convert to snake_case (e.g., "hello world" → "hello_world")
- **Kebaberize**: Convert to kebab-case (e.g., "hello world" → "hello-world")

**Technical Implementation:**

- Uses Humanizer's extension methods for robust text processing
- Implements reactive UI with state management
- Creates responsive two-panel layout with input and results sections
- Handles form validation and user interaction
- Supports real-time transformation with history tracking
- Provides code-formatted output for easy copying
