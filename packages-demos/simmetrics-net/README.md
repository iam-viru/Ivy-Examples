# SimMetrics.Net

## Description

SimMetrics.Net is a web application for measuring string similarity and distance using multiple algorithms including Levenshtein, Jaro-Winkler, Cosine, and Jaccard.

## Created With Ivy

Web application built using [Ivy-Framework](https://github.com/Ivy-Interactive/Ivy-Framework).

**Ivy** is the internal tools framework that merges UI and backend logic in a single C# project, letting you ship full-stack apps with the help of AI-assisted workflows.

## Interactive Example: String Similarity Playground

This demo showcases the [SimMetrics.Net](https://github.com/StefH/SimMetrics.Net) library inside an Ivy application. SimMetrics.Net provides a comprehensive collection of string metrics for measuring similarity and distance.

**What this application offers:**

- **Configurable Metric Selection** – choose from edit, token, q-gram, block, and vector based algorithms (Levenshtein, Jaro-Winkler, Cosine, Jaccard, and more).
- **Live Similarity Scoring** – type a name and instantly see similarity percentages for a set of randomly generated names.
- **Detailed Metric Insights** – view short and long descriptions for each metric to understand how it works.
- **Two-Panel Layout** – inputs on the left, results and guidance on the right for a clear workflow.
- **Validation Feedback** – inline validation keeps the results in sync when fields are empty or invalid.

**Technical highlights:**

- Uses Ivy `UseState` and `UseEffect` hooks to recompute similarity when the input name or metric changes.
- Renders tabular results with formatted percentage scores using Ivy table builders.
- Leverages SimMetrics.Net `AbstractStringMetric` implementations through a factory dictionary.
- Random data provided by `Bogus` for realistic sample names.
- Built entirely in a single C# view (`Apps/SimMetricsNetApp.cs`).

## How to Run Locally

1. **Prerequisites**: .NET 10.0 SDK
2. **Navigate to the example**:
   ```bash
   cd packages-demos/simmetrics-net
   ```
3. **Restore dependencies**:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```
4. **Run the app with hot reload**:
   ```bash
   dotnet watch
   ```
5. **Open your browser** to the URL printed in the console (typically `http://localhost:5010`).

## How to Deploy

Deploy this example to Ivy hosting:

1. **Navigate to the example**:
