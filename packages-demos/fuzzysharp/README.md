## Created Using Ivy

Web application created using [Ivy-Framework](https://github.com/Ivy-Interactive/Ivy-Framework).

**Ivy** - The ultimate framework for building internal tools with LLM code generation by unifying front-end and back-end into a single C# codebase. With Ivy, you can build robust internal tools and dashboards using C# and AI assistance based on your existing database.

Ivy is a web framework for building interactive web applications using C# and .NET.

## Interactive Example For Fuzzy Text Search

This example demonstrates intelligent text search using the [FuzzySharp library](https://github.com/JakeBond/FuzzySharp) integrated with Ivy. FuzzySharp is a powerful .NET library that provides fuzzy string matching capabilities, allowing you to find similar strings even with typos, misspellings, or partial matches.

**What This Application Does:**

This specific implementation creates a **Fuzzy Search** application that allows users to:

- **Intelligent Search**: Find items even with typos, misspellings, or partial text
- **Real-time Results**: Get instant search results as you type
- **Similarity Scoring**: See percentage match scores for each result
- **Visual Results**: Results displayed as colorful badges with similarity percentages
- **Interactive Examples**: Built-in examples to demonstrate fuzzy search capabilities
- **Two-Panel Layout**: Search interface on the left, results on the right

**Technical Implementation:**

- Uses FuzzySharp's `ExtractTop` method for intelligent string matching
- Implements real-time search with reactive state management
- Creates responsive badge-based result display with similarity scores
- Handles dynamic result rendering with automatic empty field removal
- Supports fuzzy matching against a comprehensive dataset of fruits and products
- Provides interactive examples for common search scenarios

## How to Run
