## Interactive Example For Excel File Analysis

This example demonstrates Excel and CSV file analysis using the [ExcelDataReader library](https://github.com/ExcelDataReader/ExcelDataReader) integrated with Ivy. ExcelDataReader is a lightweight and fast library for reading Microsoft Excel files (2.0-2021, 365).

**What This Application Does:**

This specific implementation creates an **Excel File Analyzer** that allows users to:

- **Upload Excel Files**: Support for .xlsx, .xls, and .csv file formats
- **Analyze File Structure**: Extract detailed information about sheets, columns, rows, and headers
- **View Merged Cells**: Identify and count merged cell ranges in Excel files
- **Interactive Analysis**: Two-panel layout with file upload controls and detailed results
- **Expandable Sheets**: Each sheet's information is displayed in collapsible cards
- **Real-time Statistics**: File size, total rows, columns, and merged cells count
- **Markdown Tables**: Beautiful formatted results with structured data presentation

**Technical Implementation:**

- Uses ExcelDataReader's `ExcelReaderFactory.CreateReader()` and `CreateCsvReader()` for robust file processing
- Implements automatic file type detection based on file signatures (ZIP, OLE, CSV patterns)
- Handles null reference exceptions with comprehensive error checking
- Creates responsive two-card layout with file input and analysis results
- Supports both Excel (.xlsx, .xls) and CSV file formats
- Generates detailed Markdown tables for structured data presentation
- Implements expandable components for sheet information display
