## Created Using Ivy

Web application created using [Ivy-Framework](https://github.com/Ivy-Interactive/Ivy-Framework).

**Ivy** - The ultimate framework for building internal tools with LLM code generation by unifying front-end and back-end into a single C# codebase. With Ivy, you can build robust internal tools and dashboards using C# and AI assistance based on your existing database.

Ivy is a web framework for building interactive web applications using C# and .NET.

## Interactive Example For CSV File Operations

This example demonstrates CSV file operations using the [CsvHelper library](https://github.com/JoshClose/CsvHelper) integrated with Ivy. CsvHelper is an extremely fast, flexible, and easy-to-use library for reading and writing CSV files.

**What This Application Does:**

This specific implementation creates a **Product Management** application that allows users to:

- **Create Product Records**: Fill out a form with product information (name, description, price, category)
- **Export to CSV**: Download product data as properly formatted CSV files
- **Import from CSV**: Upload CSV files to bulk import products with automatic validation
- **Manage Products**: View, add, and delete products in a real-time data table
- **Form Validation**: Validates required fields and data types for product creation
- **Interactive UI**: Split-panel layout with controls on the left and data table on the right

**Technical Implementation:**

- Uses CsvHelper's `CsvWriter` and `CsvReader` for robust CSV processing
- Generates downloadable CSV files with proper headers and formatting
- Implements file upload handling with automatic ID generation and timestamp assignment
- Creates responsive table layout with delete functionality
- Handles form submission with toast notifications and state management
- Supports custom class object serialization/deserialization
