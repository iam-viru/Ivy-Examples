## Created Using Ivy

Web application created using [Ivy-Framework](https://github.com/Ivy-Interactive/Ivy-Framework).

**Ivy** - The ultimate framework for building internal tools with LLM code generation by unifying front-end and back-end into a single C# codebase. With Ivy, you can build robust internal tools and dashboards using C# and AI assistance based on your existing database.

Ivy is a web framework for building interactive web applications using C# and .NET.

## Interactive Example For Excel File Operations

This example demonstrates Excel file operations using the [MiniExcel library](https://github.com/mini-software/MiniExcel) integrated with Ivy. MiniExcel is a fast, efficient, and zero-dependency library for reading and writing Excel files (xlsx, csv).

**What This Application Does:**

This specific implementation creates a **Student Management** application with two integrated views that allow users to:

- **Create Student Records**: Add new students with form validation (name, email, age, course, grade)
- **Edit Students**: Update existing student information through a sheet-based editing interface
- **Delete Students**: Remove students with confirmation dialogs
- **Search & Filter**: Real-time search across student fields (name, email, course, grade, age)
- **Export to Excel**: Download student data as properly formatted Excel (.xlsx) files
- **Import from Excel**: Upload Excel files to bulk import students with automatic merge/update logic
- **Real-Time Synchronization**: Automatic data synchronization between edit and view applications
- **Data Table View**: Interactive data table with sortable columns and filtering capabilities
- **Blade Navigation**: Modern blade-based UI for seamless navigation between list and detail views

**Technical Implementation:**

- Uses MiniExcel's `SaveAs` and `Query` methods for robust Excel processing
- Implements cross-app data synchronization using `DataChanged` events and `RefreshToken` mechanism
- Creates downloadable Excel files with automatic timestamp naming
- Handles file upload with ID-based merge logic (updates existing records, adds new ones)
- Implements form validation with required fields and data type constraints
- Uses `UseEffect` hooks with `RefreshToken` for reactive state management
- Supports blade navigation for detail views and editing
- Implements real-time search with case-insensitive filtering

## How to Run

1. **Prerequisites**: .NET 10.0 SDK
2. **Navigate to the example**:
   ```bash
   cd miniexcel
   ```
3. **Restore dependencies**:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```
4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   dotnet watch
   ```
5. **Open your browser** to the URL shown in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:5010`)

The application provides two separate apps:
- **MiniExcel - Edit**: Full CRUD interface with search, create, edit, and delete functionality
- **MiniExcel - View**: Data table view with Excel export/import capabilities

## How to Deploy

Deploy this example to Ivy's hosting platform:

1. **Navigate to the example**:
   ```bash
   cd miniexcel
   ```
2. **Deploy to Ivy hosting**:
   ```bash
   ivy deploy
   ```
This will deploy your Excel management application with a single command.
