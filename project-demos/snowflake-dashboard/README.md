## One-Click Development Environment

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=Ivy-Interactive%2FIvy-Examples&machine=standardLinux32gb&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fsnowflake-dashboard%2Fdevcontainer.json&location=EuropeWest)

Launch a ready-to-code workspace with:
- **.NET 10.0** SDK pre-installed
- **Snowflake.Data** SDK and Ivy tooling available out of the box
- **Zero local setup** required

## Built With Ivy

This web application is powered by [Ivy Framework](https://github.com/Ivy-Interactive/Ivy-Framework).

**Ivy** unifies front-end and back-end development in C#, enabling rapid internal tool development with AI-assisted workflows, typed components, and reactive UI primitives.

## Interactive Snowflake Analytics Dashboard

This demo showcases how to build a comprehensive analytics dashboard using the official [Snowflake .NET Connector](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-net) within an Ivy application.

### Features

- **Interactive Credentials Management** – Enter Snowflake credentials via UI or configure via user secrets
- **Cards** – Display total items, average price, min/max prices, and brand count
- **Brand Distribution Chart** – Pie chart showing distribution of top brands
- **Price Analytics** – Line charts for minimum and maximum prices by brand
- **Average Price Analysis** – Bar chart comparing average prices across brands
- **Size Distribution** – Bar chart showing size distribution for the most popular brand
- **Container Analysis** – Pie chart and bar charts for container type distribution
- **Data Tables** – Sortable table with detailed brand statistics
- **Skeleton Loading States** – Elegant loading placeholders during data fetching
- **Error Handling** – Clear error messages for connection and query issues
- **Responsive Layout** – Clean, modern dashboard interface with floating action buttons

### Configuration

The dashboard can be configured in two ways:

1. **Via UI** – Enter credentials directly in the application interface (recommended for quick testing)
2. **Via User Secrets** – Configure credentials using `dotnet user secrets` (recommended for production)

## How to Run Locally

1. **Prerequisites:** .NET 10.0 SDK and Snowflake account credentials
2. **Navigate to the project:**
   ```bash
   cd project-demos/snowflake-dashboard
   ```
3. **Set up your Snowflake credentials** (choose one):
   - **Option A:** Configure via `dotnet user secrets` (recommended):
     ```bash
     dotnet user-secrets set "Snowflake:Account" "your-account-identifier"
     dotnet user-secrets set "Snowflake:User" "your-username"
     dotnet user-secrets set "Snowflake:Password" "your-password"
     ```
     - If secrets are valid, the app will connect automatically
     - If secrets are invalid or missing, the login screen will appear
   - **Option B:** Use the UI to enter credentials when the login screen appears
     - This option is used automatically if secrets are not configured or invalid
4. **Restore dependencies:**
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```
5. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   dotnet watch
   ```
6. **Open your browser** to the URL shown in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:5010`)

## Deploy to Ivy Hosting

1. **Navigate to the project:**
   ```bash
   cd project-demos/snowflake-dashboard
   ```
2. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   ivy deploy
   ```
