A comprehensive collection of real-world examples showcasing the power and versatility of the [Ivy Framework](https://github.com/Ivy-Interactive/Ivy-Framework) integrated with popular .NET packages and libraries.

**Ivy** is the ultimate framework for building internal tools with LLM code generation by unifying front-end and back-end into a single C# codebase. With Ivy, you can build robust internal tools and dashboards using C# and AI assistance based on your existing database.

## What is Ivy?

Ivy is a revolutionary web framework that allows you to build interactive web applications using only C# and .NET. No JavaScript, no separate frontend framework - just pure C# from database to UI.

### Key Features

- **Full-Stack C#**: Write your entire application in C#
- **LLM Integration**: Build applications with AI code generation
- **Hot Reload**: See changes instantly during development
- **Web-First**: Deploy anywhere with modern web standards
- **Rich UI**: Create beautiful, interactive user interfaces
- **Responsive**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile

## Examples Collection

This repository contains **50+ working examples** that demonstrate how to integrate Ivy with popular .NET packages and libraries. Each example is a complete, runnable application showcasing real-world usage patterns.

### Complete Applications

Some examples go beyond simple demonstrations and showcase complete business applications:

- **`crm-vc`** - A full CRM system with 40+ components
- **`rental-back-office`** - Property rental management system
- **`dnsclient`** - Network diagnostics tool with multiple forms

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 10.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0) or later
- Any code editor (Visual Studio, VS Code, JetBrains Rider)

### Running an Example

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ivy-Interactive/Ivy-Examples.git
   cd Ivy-Examples
   ```

2. **Choose an example** (e.g., `helloworld`):

   ```bash
   cd helloworld
   ```

3. **Restore dependencies**:

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

4. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
   dotnet watch
   ```

5. **Open your browser** to the URL shown in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:5010`)

That's it! You now have a running Ivy application.

## Docker Support

Most examples include Docker support for easy deployment:

```bash
cd <example-name>
docker build -t ivy-example .
docker run -p 5010:5010 ivy-example
```

## One-Click Development Environment

Many examples support GitHub Codespaces for instant development:

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=Ivy-Interactive%2FIvy-Examples&machine=standardLinux32gb&location=EuropeWest)

Click the badge above to open any example in a fully configured development environment with:

- **.NET 10.0** SDK pre-installed
- **Ready-to-run** development environment
- **No local setup** required

## Deployment

Deploy any example to Ivy's hosting platform with a single command:

```bash
cd <example-name>
ivy deploy
```

This will deploy your application with automatic SSL, custom domains, and global CDN.
